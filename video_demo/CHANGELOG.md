# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0] - 2020-11-23

### Added

- [Documentation] Add demo video stats widget information to the quality and bandwidth guide
- [Documentation] Updated migration document to add more information about `bindAudioDevice()` API behavior
- Add APIs to create a messaging session with Amazon Chime SDK for Messaging

### Changed

### Removed

- [Test] Remove check for `/v2` in canary URL

### Fixed

- [Script] Update postpublish script to enable termination protection for prod canary stack.
- [Documentation] Update the Amazon Chime SDK Media Regions documentation link in the README
- Reimplement error handling in `DefaultRealtimeController` to generate less garbage.
- Add github actions fix to conditionally run integ tests

## [2.0.0] - 2020-11-18

### Added

- Add a constructor argument to `DefaultDeviceController` to specify whether Web Audio should be
  supported. Use this instead of `enableWebAudio`.
- Add an `AudioTransformDevice` type that can be supplied to `chooseAudioInputDevice`, allowing the
  injection of custom device constraints and Web Audio nodes as pseudo-devices.
- Add `VideoTransformDevice` interface placeholder. This interface mirrors `AudioTransformDevice`.
  Choosing `VideoTransformDevice`s in `DefaultDeviceController` will be implemented in a future release.
- Add Amazon Voice Focus, which allows you to create an audio input device that suppresses
  background noise.
- Add `AudioProfile` for configuring audio quality.
- Add `setAudioProfile` and `setContentAudioProfile` audio-video facade methods for setting audio quality.
- Added `GetUserMediaError` errors which are thrown for `chooseAudioInputDevice` and
  `chooseVideoInputDevice` API failures.
- [Demo] Show video WebRTC stats and attendeeId on video tile hover.
- [Demo] Add audio quality settings to meeting demo.

### Changed

- The project now produces ES2015 output, rather than ES5 output that refers to ES2015
  features. The SDK supports only modern browsers, and is increasingly dependent on ES2015
  features. This change leads to more compact bundles and aligns the supported JavaScript
  language variant with the supported runtime features.

  If you need your built application bundle to target browsers that do not
  support ES2015 syntax, including Internet Explorer, you will need to transpile the SDK code
  using a transpiler like Babel, or split your application bundle into multiple files that can
  be conditionally loaded. Note that transpiling some parts of the SDK might result in ES5 code
  that does not work when run.

- `DeviceController.createAnalyserNodeForAudioInput` now returns a `RemovableAnalyserNode` that
  knows how to unhook its own inputs. This allows you to correctly clean up, which avoids issues
  with Safari when used with Web Audio. The demo has been adjusted to do so.
- Modify `WebSocketAdapter.send` to accept string parameters.
- Changed `chooseAudioInputDevice` and `chooseVideoInputDevice` to return void and reject with a
  hierarchy of errors instead of either rejecting with an error and otherwise returning
  `DevicePermission`.

### Removed

- Remove `enableWebAudio` from `DeviceController` and related types. Use the constructor argument
  instead.
- Remove V1 meeting app. The V2 meeting app is now the only meeting app deployed. Do not supply /V2/
  paths when loading the app, if you deployed both.
- Remove legacy screen share.
- Remove `DevicePermission`.

### Fixed

- Fix Github Actions CI workflow to include all integ tests.
- Update the clicking sound answer in FAQs.
