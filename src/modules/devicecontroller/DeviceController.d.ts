/**
 * [[DeviceController]] keeps track of the devices being used for audio input
 * (e.g. microphone), video input (e.g. camera), audio output (e.g. speakers).
 * The list functions return MediaDeviceInfo objects. Once any list function is
 * called, changes in device availability are broadcast to any registered
 * [[DeviceChangeObserver]].
 *
 * Calling a choose function will request permission for the device indicated
 * by the device id or track constraint. Supply null to get the default device.
 * Make sure to choose the audio device before joining the session (even if
 * it is the default device) so that you can offer the user options if the
 * device cannot be selected before a connection is made.
 *
 * Note that in certain situations such as private tabs, the browser may
 * initially decline to provide device labels for when enumerating devices. If
 * this is the case, the internal device label trigger function is called to
 * try to coax the browser in to providing the labels. The default behavior of
 * the function is to make a microphone and camera access request which, if
 * successful, will unlock the labels. You may want to override this behavior to
 * provide a custom UX such as a prompt explaining why microphone and camera
 * access is being asked for by supplying your own function to
 * setDeviceLabelTrigger(). To disable the device label trigger, supply a
 * function that returns a rejected promise instead. For reference, the default
 * implementation calls getUserMedia for audio and video and returns the promise
 * to the stream so that the stream can be cleaned up once the labels are
 * detected.
 *
 * ```
 * (): Promise<MediaStream> => {
 *   return navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: true });
 * }
 * ```
