 * 1. The transform device is used to retrieve the constraints that identify an inner media stream.
 *    This will be managed by the controller.
 * 2. The transform device provides a Web Audio node that will be connected between the input and
 *    the output of the device controller's audio graph. This is returned as a pair, `(start, end)`,
 *    to allow an arbitrary subgraph of nodes to be returned.

 * The application should call `stop` when the device will no longer be used. This method is
